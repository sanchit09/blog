The idea of this blog to keep a diary of notes from my learnings from which others can learn from.

Being a person with multiple areas of interest in Computer Science, Mathematics, Philosophy and Pyschology,
it promises to provide with something interesting and thought provoking to read.

Hope this blog contributes back to the community from which I learnt all.
